### Project summary
Our project enables our agent, Steve (though we bring Alex in for all of the promotional material), to find resources on the user-generated terrain (currently flat), locate these resources present and chart a path to them for the user. Once Steve has found the items/resources available on the map that are needed, he navigates to these objects one by one and mines them, collects them. He continues this until there are no more objects to mine, then returns home to craft a new item from the retrieved resources. The item to be crafted can be specified by the user depending on the resources available in the given map area.


### Our plan going ahead
We have planned on using different search/pathfinding algorithms (e.g A*) and adding more complexity to the map by adding obstacles to improve navigation, an improvement in time/movement efficiency for charting the course as the agent learns from previous runs to retreive all resources and craft the item needed by the agent.
