Add in the screenshots from the proposal here, as well as some new ones from the current world version

We'll need to get a small working demo, so we can use Dijkstra's on a fully observable world and record the agent going to a block, breaking it, and then returning. Should be simple enough, and I can do it tomorrow (technically today). We'll want a small summary of the project here as well (probably can rework the one from the proposal to be more general).
